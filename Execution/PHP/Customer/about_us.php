        <div class="row">
            <p class="col">Local small independent businesses recognize the need to adapt to the changing
                consumer behaviour in order to compete with national chains. Despite several opportunities for
                locals to purchase at larger supermarkets, small businesses continue to prosper. However, with
                the introduction of convenience shops by national chains and a plan for a larger store, local
                businesses see the need to innovate in order to keep their consumer base. They acknowledge that
                a lot of locals are interested in shopping with them but aren’t able to do so since their
                working hours coincide with the store’s opening hours. As a result there is an obvious need to
                investigate alternate shopping techniques that fit the schedules of targeted end users.
            </p>
            <p class="col">As a practical solution to the issue of losing local shops in Cleckhuddersfax to
                national chains, we, Team Community Harvest, created an online platform for the residents. With
                round-the-clock accessibility, users can easily browse and purchase a wide variety of products,
                while merchants can benefit from valuable sales insights. The system not only saves time but
                also strengthens the sense of community by keeping families together and eliminating the need
                for travel. Overall, it transforms conventional shopping methods, providing a more convenient
                and connected experience for the Cleckhuddersfax community.
